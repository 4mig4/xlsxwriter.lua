Introduction
============

**Xlsxwriter** is a Lua module for writing files in the Excel 2007+ XLSX
file format.

It can be used to write text, numbers, and formulas to multiple worksheets and
it supports features such as formatting.

The main advantages of using Xlswriter are:

   * It has a high degree of fidelity with files produced by Excel. In most
     cases the files produced are 100% equivalent to files produced by Excel.

   * It has extensive documentation, example files and tests.

   * It is fast and can be configured to use very little memory even for very
     large output files.


Xlsxwriter is licensed under a MIT :ref:`License` and the source code is
available on `GitHub <http://github.com/jmcnamara/xlsxwriter.lua>`_.
